# HTML (p74-93)
## Links
**Links** allow users to move from one page to another using the &lt;a&gt; tag

There are multiple different links:
* Links to another site
* Links to another page on the same site
* Links to start up the users email
* Links that open in a new browser window
* Links to the same page but different location
* Links to a specific part of another page

# CSS (p358-404)

## Layout
* CSS treats each HTML element as its own box
* Boxes are wither block-level or inline
  * Block-level start on a new line and act as a main building block of the layout
  * Inline boxes flow between surrounding text

## CSS Positioning
* Normal Flow: every block appears on a new line
* Relative Positioning: Shifts elements to the top, left, right, bottom of where it was originally
* Absolute Positioning: Positions the element in relation to the element
* Fixed Positioning: Positions the element in relation to the browser window
* Floating Element: Takes it out of its normal position and moves it to one side
