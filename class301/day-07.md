## What Google Learned From It's Quest to Build the Perfect Team
### I read this article in 201, here are my comments from then:
While technical skill is important the idea of how act in a business environment and make others feel accepted is very important. Having the smartest people does not mean the team will be effective. A key take away from this article would be the importance of each individual feeling safe in their group because that is necessary for a good group dynamic.

## How I Explained REST to My Brother
### Who is Roy Fielding?
* Roy helped to write the first web servers and did a lot of research covering why the web works the way it does
* He also has his name on the specification protocol (HTTP)

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
* Because machines and webpages are designed to be understood by people not machines

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
* It is a way of applying verbs to nouns 
* When given a specific URL, the browser does a HTTP GET on the URL

### What does a POST do?
* It adds something to another system

### What does PUT do?
* It replaces something in another system

### What does PATCH do?
* It does a partial update
