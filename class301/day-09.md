# Functional Programming
## Functional Programming Concepts
Programming Paradigm: Style of building the structure and elements of computer programs
### Pure Functions
* Return same results if given the same arguements
* Do not cause observable side effects
* Do not rely on global variables
* Benefit from code being easy to test

### Immutability
* State cannot be changed after instantiation
* Mutibility can be handled by recursion

### Referential Transparency
* If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input
