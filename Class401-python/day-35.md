# Reading - Graphs
A non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices
## Common terminology
* Vertex: Also called a 'node' is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
* Edge: A conneciton betweentwo nodes
* Neighbor: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes
* Degree: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex

## Directed vs Undirected
* Undirected Graph
  * A graph where each edge is undirected/bi-directional. 
* Directed Graph
  * A graph where every edge is directed

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
* Complete
  * All nodes are connected to all other nodes
* Connected
  * All vertices/nodes have at least one edge
* Disconnected
  * Some vertices may not have edges

## Acyclic vs Cyclic
* Acyclic Graph
  * Directed without cycles
  * A cycle is when a node can be traveresed through and potentially end up back at itself
* Cyclic Graphs
  * A graph that has cycles
  * A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertiex
