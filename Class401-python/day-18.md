# Reading 18 - Cryptography
## Encryption, Decryption, & Hacking
### Encrypting a Message
* The act of scrambling a message to prevent someone without the "key" from understanding it
* The Caesar Cypher is a great example - swap each letter out with the letter x letters away

### Decrypting a Message
* Using a "key" to turn an encrypted message into something readable

### Cracking the Cipher
* Three Techniques:
  * Frequency Analysis
    * Utilizing the frequency of uses of specific letters like "E"
    * By narrowing down which letter could be "E" you can begin finding possible shifts
  * Known Plaintext
    * If you already know part of what the message says it would be easier to crack the code
  * Brute Force
    * Try all possible attempts and see which one has the most sensible yield
