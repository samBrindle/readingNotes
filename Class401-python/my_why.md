# Purpose Practice Sheet
## Pinpoint Your Values
* What motivates me to get up in the morning?
  * I would describe me getting up in the morning with the word discipline not motivation. I get up in the morning because I desire to become better with each day and I know that if I don't wake up in the morning I won't be able to become the person I want to be.
* What keeps me up at night?
  * The idea of not being able to give my current/future family all of the opportunites I was able to have in my own life.
* What am I doing when I'm at my best?
  * When I'm at my best, I am running every morning, eating 3-4 solid, homecooked meals, and lifting in the afternoon while succeeding in my schooling/work.
* Why am I bothered by what bothers me?
  * I am bothered by lack of drive because I used to struggle with it a lot. It bothers me because its a very hard mindset to get out of and it is very easy to feel trapped by it.
* Why do I do the work I do?
  * I code because I love the feeling I get from solving a problem with my mind. I hope to utilize it in the realworld by helping people with their issues.
* Why do I live where I live?
  * I chose to live in Washington because I love the outdoors. It has the ocean, the mountains, and everything inbetween! It allows me to be apart of a large company and have an adventurous life all in the same state.
* Why do I buy what I buy?
  * I but what I buy because it helps me in daily life or for my passions/hobbies. Whether it be food to sustain life or skis to allow me to enjoy the mountains.
* Why do I long for what I long for?
  * I long for new challenges because they help me feel content. I love the process of solving something as well as the feeling of when you finish solving it
* Why do I read and watch what I do?
  * I read and watch what I do for entertainment or knowledge. I love WWII books because they allow you to get inside the minds of people that went through that terrible time which allows you to analyze the world today in a  more in-depth way. I love comedies because they are a way to relax after long days.
* Why do I admire whom I admire?
  * I admire people whom are full of love because I feel like the world needs more love in it. Lex Fridman is a man that I would consider is in this category. While he is an extremely successful and smart person he is so full of love that he can break down concept for someone that has no knowledge in that particular field.
