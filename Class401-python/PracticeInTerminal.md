# Practice in the Terminal
* I didn't find anything from this assignment to be new to me but a key take away for me would be the cheat sheet.
* While going through the cheat sheet I had some ahah moments remembering commands that were in the back of my brain.
* Additionally, I saw some commands I had never seen or used.
* All in all this I will definitely be returning to this assignment from time to time for the cheat sheet.
