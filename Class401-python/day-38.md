# Reading - React 2
## React - Conditional Rendering
* Use conditonal operators like if to create elements reperesenting the current state
* Great for login scenarios
* You can inline with logical && operators

## React - List & Keys
* Do not transfer keys from the ListItem element to the <li> element
* keys muse be unique among siblings
  
## React - Forms
* Default behavior of browsing to a new page on form submit
* A lot of review stuff form yesterday
  
## Lifting State Up
* When several components need to reflect the same changing data, lift the shared state to the closest ancestor
* `this.state.temperature` would be `this.props.temperature` when lifting state up
