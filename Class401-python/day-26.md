## How Django works behind the scenes
* Django - an open source, Python-based web framework
* Three types of open source packages/funding:
  * Corporate Sponsor:
    * Group of engineers from a larger/for-profit compant open-source internal code
    * Examples: React(facebook), Angular(google)
    * Usually great funding but confusion around licensing aspects
  * Solo:
    * Individual developer creates the code and retains default control
    * Examples: VueJS, Tailwind CSS, Laravel
    * Lead developer raises contributions directly through add-on services or consulting services
  * Non-profit:
    * Django's approach early on (2008)
