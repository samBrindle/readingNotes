# Reading - Ethics in Tech
## Ethics in the Workplace - The code I'm still ashamed of
When starting off this article, I was not expecting it to have that serious of a topic. However, it ended up being a crazy and eye opening story about the truth behind the scenes. 
It is easy for me to think of programming as something beautiful, an art form where creative minds build applications and other things to help others or make things easier. The truth
is that not everyone or every client will have good intentions which means its up to you as an individual to decide if you want to be a part of what they are building. This is definitely 
an outlier story in the sense that very few people will be a working for companies in the pharma field, but it does a great job at portraying the very real effects code can have on other peoples lives.

## Ethics in Technology - Big Data is our Generation's Civil Rights Issue, and We Don't Know It
To me this is an article that offered no surprise. The amount of data that Big Data has on everyone is insane and it continues to grow each day. I've talked to my friends about their frequent use of
social media and the ideas behind them but they all have the same response "I have nothing to hide" or something similar. Well it is good they don't believe they have anything to hide, their privacy 
is something they are losing and with some of the information from this article it sounds like they are losing financial freedom as well. It is facinating (and sickening) to think about the use of data
from your music app being used as a reason to lower you credit spending limit. Big data is definitely a wild beast and we have a lot of work to do to figure out how to coexist with this giant, reaping 
the benefits and preventing the invasion of privacy.
