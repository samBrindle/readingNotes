# Reading 37 - React 1
## ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview
* This was essentially a refresher over JavaScript Syntax and Functionality.
* Nice review but no new information

## React - Hello World
`const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));`
`root.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);`

## React - JSX
* The <h1></h1> is not a string or HTML, its called JSX
* A syntac extension to JavaScript
* Comes with the full power of JavaScript
* Produces react 'elements' 
* Using JSX
  * Declare variable - `const name = 'Sam Brindle'`
  * Use it inside JSX by wrapping it in {} - `element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>`
