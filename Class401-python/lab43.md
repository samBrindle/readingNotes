# Python Type Hints
Type scripting sounds like it could be super effective and a great tool if utilized correctly.
One idea that comes to mind for me would be functions that handle user input. By using type hints
you could potentially prevent input of the wrong type. Outside of that I think it sort of takes away 
some of the attractive parts of Python which is that you do not need to specify the type of a variable 
or a function output.

* Pro's
  * Ability to control user input as well as function returns
  * Ability control variable types throughout functions
  * Both of these can help prevent data from becoming distrupted
  * Will speed up code since it knows what it is working with/what it will be
  * Readability
* Con's
  *  Can take away from the creative freedom that Python allows
  *  Requires more time/effort to write code
  *  Only available in Python 2.7 and newer
