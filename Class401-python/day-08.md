# Reading 08 - List Comprehensions
## Create a List with range()
* `digits = [x for x in range(10)]`
* creates a list with the content: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

## Create a List using Loops and List Comprehension
`squares = []`

`for x in range(10)`
 
 `        squares.append(x**2)`
 * creates a list with the content:  [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
 
 
 ## In conclusion
 Without copying down how to create/modify lists for every case I still managed to get great review from this article.
 Some of these solutions created new ideas on how I can trim my code down and make it more compact.
 These ideas will help not just me but colleagues/teammates down the road better understand my code.
